Project Description:


This project consists of separate APIs and frontend for managing user authentication and car information. The frontend includes sign-in and sign-up pages, and upon successful sign-up, users receive a welcome email along with a randomly generated password for logging in. After logging in, users can access a dashboard that displays the number of registered cars. The project also includes CRUD operations for car categories and car details, with features such as data tables for sorting and pagination. The system is protected against XSS attacks and implements JWT for authentication. Both frontend and backend validations are enforced during create and update operations.
